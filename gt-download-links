#The purpose of this file is to simply provide a link to current gridtracker downloads.
#The will provide an easy way to update links to the current version for BAP to use
#during the build and should overcome the download links moving to new locations. It will
#also provide a file outside of the BAP script that can easily be updated without forcing
#a new release of BAP.
